# Changes Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to fix the conflicts between `user_name` and `user_id` in the codebase.

## Code Changes

### 1. Updated Types

In `lib/types.ts`:

- Modified the `Consumption` type to use `user_id` instead of `user_name`

### 2. Updated Components

In `components/DrinkPicker/DrinkQuantitySheet.tsx`:

- Removed code that fetched user name from the `users` table
- Removed `user_name` and `user_id` from the insert query, relying on the database trigger

In `components/DrinkPicker/DrinkList.tsx`:

- Removed code that fetched user name from the `users` table
- Removed `user_name` and `user_id` from the insert query, relying on the database trigger

In `components/SummaryStats.tsx`:

- Changed props from `userName` to `userId`
- Updated queries to filter by `user_id` instead of `user_name`

In `components/DashboardClient.tsx`:

- Updated the `Drink` interface to use `user_id` instead of `user_name`
- Modified the `fetchDrinks` function to not set `user_name` anymore

### 3. Created Migration Files

Created `migrations/drop_user_name.sql`:

```sql
-- Drop the user_name column from consumption table
ALTER TABLE consumption DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS user_name;

-- Drop the users table if it exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
```

## Documentation

Created `README_MIGRATION.md` with instructions on how to apply the migration and verify the changes.

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Simplified Data Model**: The application now uses a single consistent identifier (`user_id`) for users.
2. **Improved Security**: User identification is now tied directly to the authentication system.
3. **Better Data Integrity**: The database trigger ensures `user_id` is always filled correctly.
4. **Reduced Code Complexity**: Removed redundant code that managed both `user_name` and `user_id`.

## Next Steps

1. Apply the SQL migration in the Supabase SQL editor
2. Test the application to ensure everything works correctly
3. Consider updating any other components that might still reference `user_name` or the `users` table
